# Graph-Ranker
Management of Many Weighted Graphs
INPUT: -2 parameters D and K (read only one time in the first line of the file)
            D--> number of nodes of the graph
            K--> size of the rank
       -One instruction between AGGIUNGI GRAFO and TOPK
            AGGIUNGIGRAFO--> adds the graph(matrix) to the set
            TOPK-->prints the rank until that moment
