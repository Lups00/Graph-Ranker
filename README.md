# Graph-Ranker
That's my first project :)

Management of Many Weighted Graphs

INPUT: 

       -2 parameters D and K (read only one time in the first line of the file)
            D--> number of nodes of the graph
            K--> size of the rank
       -One instruction between AGGIUNGI GRAFO and TOPK
            AGGIUNGIGRAFO--> adds the graph(matrix) to the set
            TOPK-->prints the rank until that moment
